Task 3: Calculate Inverse and Forward Kinematics for a Robot with 3 Degrees of Freedom
Description
This task involves calculating the Forward Kinematics (FK) and Inverse Kinematics (IK) for a robotic arm with 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoF). The goal is to determine the position and orientation of the robot's end-effector based on the joint angles (FK) and to find the required joint angles to achieve a desired end-effector position (IK).

Forward Kinematics (FK)
Forward Kinematics involves determining the position and orientation of the robot's end-effector (usually a gripper or tool) based on the joint angles.

Steps for FK:
Define the Transformation Matrices for each Joint: Each joint's transformation matrix depends on its respective joint angle (θ_i) and link length (L_i).
For Joint 1:
 
For Joint 2:
 
For Joint 3:
 
Compute the Overall Transformation Matrix: Combine the transformation matrices of all joints to get the overall transformation from the base to the end-effector.
 T = T_1 x T_2 x T_3
Extract the End-Effector Position: The position of the end-effector in the workspace can be obtained from the translation part of the final transformation matrix 𝑇.
 [x,y,z] = [T_14, T_24, T_34]
Inverse Kinematics (IK)
Inverse Kinematics involves determining the joint angles (𝜃_1, 𝜃_2, 𝜃_3) that achieve a desired end-effector position.

Steps for IK:
Specify the Desired End-Effector Position: Choose the desired position (𝑥_𝑑, 𝑦_d, 𝑧_𝑑) in the workspace where you want the end-effector to move.

θ_3 ≈ arctan2 (−2,4.24) − 30.96 − 45 ≈ −18.43 degrees
These calculated angles 𝜃_1 ≈ 45, θ_2 ≈ 30.96, and 𝜃_3 ≈ −18.43 degrees would position the end-effector at the desired coordinates.
